Can't Stop is a board game for 1-5 players. The goal is to be the first player to advance a token to the end of three different paths.

On your turn, you can choose "Roll" to push your luck, or "Stop". After each roll, you again choose to continute to roll or stop. Your turn ends when you either chose to stop, or <i>bust</i>, losing all progress that turn.

When you "Roll", roll 4 dice. Arrange the dice into two numbers however you wish. For example, rolling 1, 2, 3, and 4, you might choose to make <b>3</b> (1 + 2) and <b>7</b> (3 + 4). In this version, the math is done for you.

Then, advance on paths 3 and 7 (or whichever two numbers you selected).

To advance on a path with no black marker, add a new one from the storage area on the bottom-left. New markers are added at the bottom of the path, or after after your pawn on the path if you have one.

To advance on a path with a black marker, move it forward one. If there is no marker, instead 

There are only three black markers available in the storage at the bottom-left. You cannot advance on a path with no black marker if the supply is empty.

If you can only advance on one of the two paths you choose, that's okay. Just advance on one.

If you can't advance on either path, you <i>bust</i>, losing this turn's progress. The markers are returned to the storage, and your turn ends.

If you choose to stop (which must be done <i>before</i> you roll), advance your pawns to replace the black markers.

If your pawn advances to the end of the path, the path is now <i>blocked</i>. The path is out of play for the rest of the game. No additional markers can be advanced or placed.

The first player to advance to the end of three columns wins.
